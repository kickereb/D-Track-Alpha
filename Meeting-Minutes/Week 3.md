### Attendees:
- Lennox Avdiu
- Tom Zhu
- Evam Kaushik
- Ranjeet
- Damith

### Absent:
- Everyone attended

### Agenda:
1. Presentation feedback
2. What we should focus on
3. Dataset creation and Y-track dataset

### Discussion Points:
1. Presentation feedback
   - Key points discussed
      - Main feedback addressed in slack
      - Need to be more cohesive in presenting our objectives, make sure images reflect what we are talking about
      - Homography/geometric solution is a fallback, focus on distributed solutions
      
2. What we should focus on
   - Key points discussed
      - Important suggestion to look up the Y-track dataset, our benchmark dataset should resemble this
      - Get something simple working first, next presentation is demo
      - Connection is simple between pi, ethernet via switch or wifi
      - Damith is happy to share their detection/ai code
   - Decisions made
      - Use of clustering with posenet detection as projected solution for tracking
   - Action items
      - Read up on Y-track
      - Setup a benchmark dataset

3. Dataset creation and Y-track dataset
   - Key points discussed
      - Should be available on the Damith paper, either 2021 or 2023
      - Take a good variety of photos in different conditions as to encompass a good benchmark
      - External datasets can be good but for AI training purposes

### Action Items:
- [ ] Read up on Y-track: Assigned to Lennox, Tom, Due before next meeting (Currently a little lost on where it is in the paper - Tom)
- [ ] Schedule a meeting with hardware (and) to create dataset: TODO

### Next Meeting:
**Date:** 16/08/2024  
**Time:** 4:00pm - 4:30pm  
**Location:** Barr Smith South/1062/Teaching Room
